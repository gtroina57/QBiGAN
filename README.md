This repository contains the implementation of a new hybrid architecture QBiGAN Quantum Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 

This software is based on the evolution of the architecture Patch Quantum Wasserstein GAN (PQWGA) proposed 
in paper S. L. Tsang, M. T. West, S. M. Erfani and M. Usman, "Hybrid Quantum–Classical Generative Adversarial Network for High-Resolution Image Generation," in IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering, vol. 4, pp. 1-19, 2023 and
(Hybrid Quantum–Classical Generative Adversarial Network for High-Resolution Image Generation | IEEE Journals & Magazine | IEEE Xplore).   Tsang's paper contains the code to run the simulations at https://github.com/jasontslxd/PQWGAN
